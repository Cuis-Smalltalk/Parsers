OMeta/Cuis
==========

# Overview

OMeta/Cuis started as a port of OMeta/Squeak to Cuis but is quickly turning into a bit more so naming it OMeta/Cuis and moving it to its own repository reflects that.  It is intended to be compatible with OMeta/Squeak where possible so most existing grammars should work without changes.  One additional benefit to having its own repository is that it is now possible to include add-on parsers without cluttering up my Cuis-Ports repository.
